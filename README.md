# Maze Generation with Turtle

===========================

## Overview

--------

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to generate a maze using the depth-first search algorithm. The maze is drawn on the screen, showcasing the intricate patterns created during the maze generation process.

### Maze Generation Algorithm

-------------------------

The depth-first search algorithm for maze generation starts at a random cell with odd coordinates. The maze is represented as a 2D grid, with 0 indicating unvisited cells and 1 indicating visited cells.

1\.  Initialize a 2D grid for the maze.

2\.  Choose a random starting cell with odd coordinates to simplify the process.

3\.  Use a stack to keep track of visited cells during the maze generation process.

4\.  Mark the starting cell as visited (set it to 1).

5\.  While there are unvisited cells:

    -   Randomly choose a neighboring cell that has not been visited.

    -   Move to the chosen cell and mark it as visited.

    -   Push the current cell onto the stack.

    -   If there are no unvisited neighbors, pop a cell from the stack.

The process continues until all cells are visited, resulting in a maze with intricate paths and dead ends.

### Turtle Graphics Setup

---------------------

The Turtle graphics environment is set up with the following configurations:

-   Turtle speed is appropriately set.

-   The turtle is hidden to provide a clean visualization of the maze.

-   A background color is chosen for a visually appealing display.

### Customization (Optional)

------------------------

The script allows for additional customization, such as changing the starting point or incorporating different colors for aesthetic purposes. Feel free to experiment with these parameters to create unique and visually interesting mazes.

### Running the Script

------------------

To run the script, simply execute the Python file. The maze generation process will commence, and the resulting maze will be displayed using Turtle graphics.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your preferences and experiment with different maze generation algorithms or visual styles.

*Note: The generated maze does not guarantee solvability, and the focus is on the visual representation rather than creating a playable maze.*
